"Growing up with my father he would attempt to teach me basic knowledge of computers such as taking them apart and building it back together while ensuring that it would run perfect. This sparked the begining of my curiosity behind computers. Years later we encountered Myspace, where I was first introduced to somewhat concept of coding. making a page and interaction such as music, layout and friends. From this point I was attached to the many different ways one can express, like art. After graduating college and taking up a major, accounting, wanting to get knowledge in better financial decisions I realized I took the wrong field since I was not happy in life. I resorted back to what sparked up my life as a child, basic coding, taking up a small bootcamp in my college for free. Since then the cusriosty and desire to change my job field grew."
